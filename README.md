# implementation
[py.Processing](http://py.processing.org): the python mode of [Processing](https://processing.org/) <br />
Follows [Aaron Hertzmanns' Painterly Rendering Algorithm](https://mrl.nyu.edu/publications/painterly98/) as seen outlined [here](http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/lanortha/CourseProjects/Painterly/painterly.html). 

## Getting Started
Download Processing and its python mode. Download the zip and move it to your Processing directory. Add photos you would like to use to the data folder, change the name of the photo to the photo you would like to filter and update the size() parameters accordingly. Hit run to see the updated image. Note: this may take a few seconds.
